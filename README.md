# TextBasedRPG
Final exam for a second-year object-oriented programming course on the Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies 

## Dependencies

No dependencies are required! Just open .sln file in Visual studio (or any other supporting IDE) and start the project! The rest is old text-rpg goodie.

P. S: Don't worry, the game is designed to be very easy pr very hard to complete, no between!
